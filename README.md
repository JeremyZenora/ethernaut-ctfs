# ethernaut-ctfs
I am using `Foundry` framework for solving the CTFs, I find it to be the most convenient one, you can just use solidity language to complete everything, no JS or PYTHON needed.

I solved 31 Ethernaut challenges in &lt;4 days. I did not include the script file for most challenges, however if some more complex logic is needed for interacting with the contracts, it should be in the `Attacks` files.

For sure by the time you read this, there might be more CTFs added, I might add them in the future as well:) 

to install libraries:
```
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```
to install Huff (you need npm):
```
npm install -g huffc
forge install huff-language/huff-rs
```

for debugging, installation problems or anything else, ask your buddy `ChatGPT`.
